# TibetanEditor

TibEdit is an under-development, all-purpose word editor for the Tibetan language. With TibEdit, you can: (1) segment words (put a space between words); (2) spell-check (starting next release); (3) grade readability (based on a frequency word list, writers can see which words are easy; difficult; etc., user-defined); and more to come. Planned for next release: user-defined spell-checker rules and segmentation rules. 

To use TibEdit, follow these steps: 

(1) Download and install the latest version of Python (currently 3.6; must be above 3.0) appropriate for your machine: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

(2) Install PyQT5 (from a command prompt, type: pip install pyqt5 and press enter) -- (to get a command prompt window, hit the windows key and type "cmd" or "command prompt" -- it is a usually black window that will prompt you with something that looks like "C:\Users\yourname>" -- simply type the command, exactly as written, and press "enter")

(3) 

(4) *OPTIONAL* move your tibEDIT folder to your Documents or Programs folder; right-click on "tibEDIT" and create a shortcut to place on your Desktop to easily find and use the program!
